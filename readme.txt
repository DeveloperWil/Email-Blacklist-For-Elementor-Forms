Adds a text area control called "Blacklist" to the Elementor Forms control. Blocks outgoing emails if they match with any on the blacklist.

== Description ==

If you need to prevent email addresses or entire email domains from being sent on an Elementor Form, this plugin will do that.

Stop unwanted Elementor Forms spam and create an email or domain name block list for your forms.

This is for Elementor Pro users only. This will not work with the free version of Elementor as it doesn't support forms.

Nope.

Nope. Enter a full email address like this "bob@yandex.com" or a domain name like this "@yanex.com".

Probably not but it's your site, so your choice.  Expect some unhappy support tickets.
